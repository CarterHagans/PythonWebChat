              ------------------ GOALS FOR V1 ------------------
This is a Python Web application. It will be an application where users will be able to 
chat with people on their local network. Each room should have a unique ID, to identify rooms
users will not need to make an account but will need to specify a room creation or to join a 
room. Users will be able to private message one another, as well as talk publically in global
channels on their LAN.


              ------------------ GOALS FOR V2 ------------------
In version 2, users should be able to play minigames inside of public or private chats, 
such as 20 questions more minigame ideas to come. Another feature should be to include 
more channel customization, such as pinning messages, setting channel descriptions, and more. 
Creators of the room will be able to remove users from the room, as well as give other
channel permissions. 



              ------------------ GOALS FOR V3 ------------------
In version 3, users should be able to create their own accounts, storing more
data based on the user. With the addition of user accounts, host of rooms 
and admins will be able to ban the actual account instead of just an
established connection to the room. Another feature that could be implemented
in room 3 is the ability to have a music controller in which users can join
a "music room" where will have a host and all users in this room will be able
to hear the music playing in this room, will connect to spotify API.
